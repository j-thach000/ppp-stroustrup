6. Now change the body of the loop so that it reads just one double each
time around. Define two variables to keep track of which is the smallest
and which is the largest value you have seen so far. Each time through
the loop write out the value entered. If itâ€™s the smallest so far, write the
smallest so far after the number. If it is the largest so far, write the largest
so far after the number.
