ch02: setting up a programming environment
- compilation (translating the source code to machine)
- linking (combining all the parts into the executable)

ch03: getting, storing, and using data
- reading/writing inputs from keyboard
- storing input from keyboard via assignment and initialization (objects, variables)
- handling data types: values, operations, and emphasizing type safety

ch04: computation (getting a certain output from certain input)
- emphasizing programmer ideals: correctness, simplicity, and efficiency
- organizing a program by breaking down computations into pieces (abstraction, divide and conquer)

- using expressions to compute values
- using constant expressions to improve code readability (avoiding magic numbers)
- using expressions that involve conversions between data types

- using selection statements (if-else, switch)
- using iterative statements (while, for)
- using functions to specify and separate computations
- using vectors to hold data for computations

ch05: errors
- dealing with errors
- exceptions
- debugging
- testing
