# syntax
// - comment
    indicates the beginning of a comment in which statements after it are not read by the program
    comments are used to provide information to humans about the program

<< - insertion operator
    indicates the direction data is moving in 

std::cout - object from <iostream> 
    object that outputs data to console

#include - directive 
    before compilation there's the translation phase in which the .cpp file is scanned and the text is manipulated
    the #include directive replaces the directive with the content of ex: <iostream>

main() - main function
    the function called by the program that is the starting point to execute statements

# concepts
C++
    a general purpose programming language that focuses on giving the programmer freedom (aka trust the programmer)
    also a large emphasis the ability to control memory management

comment 
    used to give information about the program to the reader
    describe "what" for groups of statements as a high level overview
    describe "why" for individual statements and "magic numbers"

compiler
    used to translate high level programming languages to machine language
    it detects syntax errors which violate the language's rules

compile-time error
    an error occurring at compilation when the syntax of the language is violated

executable
    the result of linking object files and the standard library together 
    it makes the computer hardware run a set of instructions

function    
    a named collection of statements that execute in sequential order

header
    *defining header file
    at the top of the program
    it's a file that acts as an interface between the separately compiled parts of the program (object files)
    it allows these object files to access declarations which are just named entities (objects, variables, functions, etc.)

IDE (integrated development environment)
    a gui program with a suite of tools including:
        - text editor
        - compiler
        - linker
        - syntax check
        - debugger

library
    a package of code made for reuse in other programs that provide a desired functionality

linker  
    a program that connects object code from the compilation process and library files
    it also checks for cross-file dependencies
    once those processes are done, it creates an executable which tells the hardware what to do

object code 
    machine code resulting from the compilation process in object files
    it hasn't be linked up yet to all other relevant object files

output  
    the result of the program's execution

program 
    a set of instructions for the hardware to execute

source code 
    the code written in a high level language before it is compiled
    it's a series of statements which act as instructions for the hardware

statement
    an instruction for the program to perform some action 
    *difference between the statement making the program do something and the program making the computer do something
